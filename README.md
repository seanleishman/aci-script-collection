# Cisco ACI Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts developed to automate and interact with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) environments. These scripts were originally developed for internal use during my time at Cisco to assist customers with operational tasks, visibility, and data extraction.

They are shared here for educational and demonstration purposes to showcase my experience working with Cisco ACI, REST APIs, and network automation. These are *not* official Cisco tools. Feel free to check them out and of course let me know if there are any questions or comments you may have.
